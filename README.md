# Database of Lucan Manuscripts

<https://enury.github.io/lucan-mss>

### Work in progress!
I'm looking at some manuscripts containing Lucan's *De bello civile* or related materials, and making public the list of manuscripts in case it would be useful to someone else.

The table is very far from complete. Most manuscripts are heavily annotated, so if for instance there is nothing in the column for Anthol.lat.668 (Lucan's epitaph *Corduba me genuit...*), it does not mean that I have checked the whole manuscript and that I can guarantee it's absence but rather that I have not seen it at the start of the text where it usually appears.
